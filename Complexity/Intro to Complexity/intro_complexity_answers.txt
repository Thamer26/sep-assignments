1. O(1) is like a hockey puck moving across ice at a constant speed no matter
   the distance it travels, and O(2^n) is like a snowball rolling uphill while
   accumulating mass on the way up.

2. Best case for binary search is that the item we're searching for is always the
  median value of the collection.

3. Worst case for binary search is that the item we're searching for is always
  at either end of the collection.

4. The bounded case for binary search is that the item we're searching for is
  either the median value, the value at either end of the collection, or somewhere
  in between.
